# Software Deployment Project
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The code in this project is part of the third assignment.  The intension is to show the use of
GitHub as a source control repository that is being used by a team of developers.  As the
program code was supplied as part of the assignment, there won't actually be any real code
development.
